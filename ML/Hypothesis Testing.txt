                                              Hypothesis Testing.
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

1. Write the null hypothesis H0 and alternate hypothesis Ha; then identify the claim and decide whether the
test is left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed.
2. Identify the level of significance, a.
3. Determine the standardized test statistic z.
4. Find the area that corresponds to z (as before - use Table).
5. Find the P-value.
left-tailed test: P = (Area in left tail)
right-tailed test: P = (Area in right tail)
two-tailed test: P = 2(Area in tail of test statistic)
6. Make a decision to reject H0 or fail to reject H0.
If P <= a, then reject H0
If P > a, then fail to reject H0
7. Interpret the decision in the context of the original claim

Example 1:
----------
The percentage of all women with gray hair is 25%.
H0 = 25%
HA != 25%
alpha = 0.05

Sample of 100 women had 20% with gray Hair.

The standard error for your sample percentage is the square root of p(1-p)/n which equals 0.04 or 4%. 
You find the test statistic by taking the proportion in the sample with gray hair
z= (0.20-0.25)/sqrt(0.20*(1-0.20)/100) 
 = -0.05/0.04
 = -1.25

p = 2*0.1056 ( as it is a two sided scenario )
  = 0.2112
Here p is lesser than alpha hence we will reject the H0

Example 2:
----------
A business knows that 30% of its customers are less than 25 years old. 
The business wants to increase this percentage, 
After the campaign, the business obtained a random sample of 50 customers and found that 18 of those sampled were less than 25 years old.
H0 = 30%
HA > 30%
mean 18/50 = 0.36

z= (0.36-0.30)/sqrt(0.30*(1-0.30)/50) 
 = 0.06/0.0648
 = 0.9259

P = 0.1711
P > alpha, we failed to reject H0
